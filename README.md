# What is it?
Let me explain, since I can't make my life easy and buy a ready to use 3D printer, I use 2 vorons with the glorious firmware called klipper. It is composed of a linux computer interpreting the files and control unit(s) running the printer. These are the config files that are parsed at every printer startup to make it work,

### Enjoy!
